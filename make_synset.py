""" ImageNet Training Script

This is intended to be a lean and easily modifiable ImageNet training script that reproduces ImageNet
training results with some of the latest networks and training techniques. It favours canonical PyTorch
and standard Python style over trying to be able to 'do it all.' That said, it offers quite a few speed
and training result improvements over the usual PyTorch example scripts. Repurpose as you see fit.

This script was started from an early version of the PyTorch ImageNet example
(https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet)

NVIDIA CUDA specific speedups adopted from NVIDIA Apex examples
